# KitaevHoneycombDefect
MATLAB functions for creating an effective Hamiltonian for the Kitaev Honeycomb model, restricted to particular vortex sector of its' Hilbert space, on lattices with periodic boundary conditions and a dislocation defect

The script Diagonalise.m uses the functions HamiltonianDelta.m, printVortexConfig.m and 
constructHamiltonian.m to construct the Hamiltonian for the Kitaev Honeycomb model with 
a lattice defect and plots the two eigenvectors with lowest absolute energy. These vectors
become zero-energy modes of of the model in the presence of vortices and/or a lattice defect.
